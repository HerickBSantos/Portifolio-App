      <h2>Finite Element Analysis in Catia V5-6</h2>
      <p>I performed an FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to analyze the forces acting on a clamp used in aerospace assemblies. The objective was to evaluate the structural integrity of the clamp under various load conditions. I created a detailed 3D model of the clamp in CATIA V5-6 and then applied boundary conditions and loads to simulate real-world operational forces. The analysis involved meshing the component and studying stress distribution, deformation, and potential failure points. Through this process, I identified areas that required reinforcement and optimized the design to ensure the clamp could withstand high stress without compromising its functionality. This project enhanced my understanding of material behavior under load and the importance of design validation in critical applications.</p>
