      <h2>Advanced Surfaces in Catia V5-6</h2>
      <p>One of the most challenging projects I completed involved creating advanced surfaces in CATIA V5-6 for a complex aircraft component. The goal was to design an aerodynamic surface with precise curvature and smooth transitions between different segments. I utilized various advanced surfacing tools, such as multi-section surfaces and sweep operations, to model the intricate geometry. The project required a high level of attention to detail to ensure the surfaces were not only visually accurate but also met the stringent engineering requirements. By carefully managing continuity and alignment, I was able to create a flawless surface that adhered to industry standards and was successfully integrated into the larger assembly.</p>
