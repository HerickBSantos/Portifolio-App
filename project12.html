      <h2>Sheet Metal in Catia V5-6</h2>
      <p>In one of my projects, I focused on designing a sheet metal component for an aerospace application using CATIA V5-6. The task involved creating a complex part that would be lightweight yet durable, suitable for high-stress environments. I utilized the sheet metal workbench to model features such as bends, flanges, and cutouts while ensuring manufacturability and adherence to material thickness constraints. During the design process, I had to account for factors such as material springback and flat pattern development to ensure the component could be accurately fabricated. The project not only sharpened my skills in sheet metal design but also deepened my understanding of how to balance structural integrity with weight efficiency in aerospace components.</p>
